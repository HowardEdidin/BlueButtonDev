How to use pyOIDC
=================

:Release: |release|
:Date: |today|

Before you can use pyOIDC, you'll need to get it installed.
If you have not done it yet, read the :ref:`install`

Once you have it installed you can try to run the examples.
There is one OP example (oc3) and three RP examples (rp1, rp2 and rp3).
I'd recommend that you start by looking at rp3 it's the simplest one.
